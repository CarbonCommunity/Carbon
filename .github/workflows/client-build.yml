          Carbon 4 client (or "C4C") is a sub-project which allows extended communication between Carbon servers and clients running C4C. 
          It allows developers to load up various features and content server and client-side.
          
          Read [more] info about how to get started.

          ### How to install
          1. Download the `Carbon.Client.Release.zip` archive from the attachments below.
          2. Unzip the archive to the root of your Rust Client.
          3. Launch RustClient.exe (and not through Steam or Rust.exe, as EAC must be disabled)
          
          ### How to uninstall
          1. Move or remove the `winhttp.dll` from the root of your Rust client.
          2. Launch Rust through Steam or with EAC as usual. C4C is completely disabled.
